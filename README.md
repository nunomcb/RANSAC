# RANSAC

It Detects circles and calculates the minimum width annulus for them. It is also possible to visualize the Voronoi diagrams, the convex hull and the Delaunay triangulation. The Line class wasn't properly implemented, therefore the program can crash because of inner calculations with vertical lines(rarely, though).
